				"content_text": "I've been keeping a 'creative notebook' for the better part of the year. I was trying to learn many things at once, and wanted to help make sense of it.\r\n\r\nHere are some things I wrote in my creative notebook about the three main things I worked on this year in my practice: taking photos, playing alto sax, and learning darkroom as well as inkjet printing.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20230823-kodakportra400-leica-castro-020-positive-square.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo of a colorful bridge in the Castro in San Francisco in a cropped square format\">\r\n\r\n*Bridge at Dolores Park, San Francisco. (Leica M3, Kodak 250D)*\r\n\r\n### Learning film photography\r\n\r\n#### What I set out to learn: \r\n\r\n- shoot ten thousand photos in 2023 on color, black and white and slides. (I got to 7000, and did a lot of color and black and white, but only a few slides). I wanted to do this as I had not been taking photos on film for more than a decade. I figured the more photos I took, the more I would learn.\r\n- learn to load film from 100ft bulk rolls (done: I load black and white, as well as slide film and motion picture film regularly)\r\n- learn to load film in film dev tank (done: the hardest thing to do was not be so impatient. That led to many kinks and crimping in the film, early on)\r\n- learn to develop black and white, C-41 (color) and ECN-2 (motion picture film) (done: I don't enjoy the ECN-2, but can easily do the rest)\r\n- how to scan 35mm and medium format film using a Fuji Frontier as well as home scanners (done: it's a regular part of my creative workflow now)\r\n\r\n### What I learned: \r\n\r\n1. Things that seem intimidating are quickly learned, once you try\r\n2. Some things feel complex and overwhelming if you try to intellectualize things in your brain. Getting motivated to just do it is more important than thinking about how to do them perfectly or expertly\r\n3. Mistakes happen, and we can learn from them but mistakes that arise from being careless (for example, if I try to develop 5 rolls of film at once but I'm exhausted before I begin, I am likely to make cascading mistakes) can be avoided by being mindful of my current state\r\n4. Get rested before trying new things, especially if it is a difficult thing or something I have 'failed' at previously\r\n5. Don't forget to have fun\r\n\r\n### Learning to play jazz\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20231123-minoltahimatic7sii-tmax400-perceptol-12-031-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" alt=\"a scan of a black and white photo of Charles Unger, a saxophone jazz player in San Francisco, playing a horn\">\r\n\r\n*Charles Unger of the Charles Unger Experience trying out my Yamaha alto sax. (Minolta Hi-Matic 7S II, Kodak T-Max 400, Perceptol 1:2)*\r\n\r\n #### What I set out to do with music: \r\n\r\n- learn to improvise to play jazz standards\r\n- spend more time practicing my alto sax every week\r\n- be able to easily play the high E, F and G\r\n\r\nI think I got to do all of that, and have greatly improved my improv skills but I still need to work on it.\r\n\r\n#### What I learned\r\n\r\n1. My classical music grounding has given me many skills: I can play almost anything written, I can still sightread extremely well, I can play 'in time' easily\r\n2. However, I need to keep working on improvisation so it feels less like a mystery, and more like second nature\r\n3. To do this, I need to keep practising \r\n4. Go back to basics: work on all scales and chords\r\n5. Practice all the jazz standards\r\n6. Spend as much time out there with working musicians as I can: I notice that if I do, even if I'm just messing around, I pick up new skills exponentially, as if by osmosis\r\n7. Things that are hard on my own at home: playing the high F on the alto sax, comes almost instantly when I'm in a music studio environment with other musicians and just 'fiddling'\r\n8. Same as with photography, don't intellectualize too much: trust yourself to reach a note or be able to find the right ones, and just do it\r\n\r\n### Learning to print (darkroom and inkjet)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/000010-7-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"a scan of a black and white photo of a bride coming out of San Francisco City Hall\">\r\n\r\n*Bride at San Francisco City Hall. (Yashica Mat 124G, Kodak T-Max 400, Rodinal 1:50)*\r\n\r\n#### What I set out to do with printing:\r\n\r\n- learn how to print photos using different types of paper on an Epson SureColor P7570\r\n- print inkjet color and black and white photos\r\n- learn how to print black and white photos in a darkroom\r\n- learn how to print color photos in a darkroom\r\n\r\nI got to do all that! And really love this more than I thought I would.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### What I learned\r\n\r\n1. Don't get nervous about not knowing or remembering all the things\r\n3. The more darkroom time I get, the more naturally it will come to me\r\n4. I've already exceeded my own expectations by being able to actually produce an image (for both black and white, and color): doing something almost entirely in the dark is less anxiety-inducing than when I started \r\n5. Practice as much as you can\n",

But Bencoolen Street is still the place of temples, synagogues, churches and street life that I remember it to be.\r\n\r\nI even got my film developed and scanned in 3 hours (shout out to Triple D Minilab)!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100004-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing a geometric office building juxtaposed against another one\">\r\n\r\nWindows.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100007-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing a man leaning against the side of a temple wall, and a truck on the right side of the photo\">\r\n\r\nTemples and trucks.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100006-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing a carving of a Hindu deity on the side of the Sri Krishnan temple\">\r\n\r\nDeities.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100008-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing devotees praying at a Hindu temple in Singapore\">\r\n\r\nPrayers.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100018-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing the exterior of a Japanese-inspired coffee shop in Singapore called Kurasu\">\r\n\r\nGreat coffee.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100029-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing little weird statues of cats, swans and rabbits in a car park in singapore\">\r\n\r\nCats, swans, rabbits.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100022-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing the exterior of an intricate old building in singapore with green, pink and yellow colors\">\r\n\r\nHeritage.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100035-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing two cartoonish green characters by the side of a long hallway\">\r\n\r\nGoogly eyes.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100030-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing a historical green building\">\r\n\r\nGreen.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/001302100013-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo showing a fedex van by the side of a historical green building\">\r\n\r\nObjectifs, a non-profit arts space dedicated to film and photography.\n",

Other days it's an [Aztec dance](https://missionlocal.org/2023/01/celebrating-25-years-of-aztec-dance-in-the-mission/).\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20230820-kodakporta400-leicam3-missionsf-035-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" alt=\"a scan of a color photograph of a door sign in the Mission in San Francisco. it says 3144 on a black mailbox, and is surrounded by a pink wall\">\n\n*Beautiful colors all over 24th Street.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20230820-kodakporta400-leicam3-missionsf-024-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo of some Mexican breads and pastry in a bakery's glass window. Next to it, some musical instruments and tools rest against the wall on the sidewalk outside, showing an interesting contrast\">\n\n*All the things I love.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20230820-kodakporta400-leicam3-missionsf-019-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"408\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo of a man walking down a sidewalk while a jazz band plays on\">\n\n*Everyone makes room here.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20230820-kodakporta400-leicam3-missionsf-009-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"420\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo of ice cream flavors on a chalkboard in the Mission, with interesting flavors like vietnamese coffee and hong kong milk tea\">\n\n*Delicous ice cream too.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/20230820-kodakporta400-leicam3-missionsf-029-positive.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" alt=\"a scan of a color photo of a red wooden cart that says Books for one dollar. in the background, a person stands sweeping the sidewalk, but you can only see their legs\">\n\n*Many book stores too.*\n\nIf you ever find yourself on 24th Street, be sure to hit up some of my faves:\n\n- Tacos del Barrio\n- La Espiga de Oro\n- La Torta Gorda\n- Deliciosos Tacos de Canasta Mexican (a street taco stand that's only open in the mornings at the intersection with Folsom St)\n- La Palma\n- La Gallinita\n- Humphry Slocombe\n\n*All photos taken on a Leica M3, 50mm Summilux, Kodak Portra 400, self-developed and scanned.*\n",

				"content_html": "<p>To me, the best thing about living in the Bay Area is the easy access to all kinds of nature, by bike and by other means of transportation. You can put your bicycle on nearly every form of public transit (except Muni street car): all buses, almost all trains, and also by ferry. This makes bike-powered weekend trips a lot easier. Our hills are treacherous, and our beer is decent: sometimes you want to skip a hill or roll down one. Put your bike on a ferry, bus, train.</p>\n<p>Recently, I did one such trip with a friend where we boarded a ferry to Larkspur and then a train to Petaluma. While I find it easier to just cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge and get in the miles, on days where I want longer rides, I&rsquo;m thankful to these multi-modal options on easier days when I just want to take it slow but still be further from home, on a bike.</p>\n<p>I also recently came into the possession of a Nikonos V. The seller was very apologetic that its meter wasn&rsquo;t working, and that its O-rings needed work before it can be a truly amphibious camera again: but I was not, for I managed to own a Nikonos V for $50 instead of $500. Although it looks like a toy camera, it is one of the most ergonomic and user friendly cameras I have ever used. It puts a modern GoPro to shame. You can even scuba dive with it (after getting the O-rings serviced).</p>\n<p>As someone who enjoys manual metering, I am not afraid of film cameras without batteries and meters.

				"content_text": "To me, the best thing about living in the Bay Area is the easy access to all kinds of nature, by bike and by other means of transportation. You can put your bicycle on nearly every form of public transit (except Muni street car): all buses, almost all trains, and also by ferry. This makes bike-powered weekend trips a lot easier. Our hills are treacherous, and our beer is decent: sometimes you want to skip a hill or roll down one. Put your bike on a ferry, bus, train.\n\nRecently, I did one such trip with a friend where we boarded a ferry to Larkspur and then a train to Petaluma. While I find it easier to just cycle across the Golden Gate Bridge and get in the miles, on days where I want longer rides, I'm thankful to these multi-modal options on easier days when I just want to take it slow but still be further from home, on a bike.\n\nI also recently came into the possession of a Nikonos V. The seller was very apologetic that its meter wasn't working, and that its O-rings needed work before it can be a truly amphibious camera again: but I was not, for I managed to own a Nikonos V for $50 instead of $500. Although it looks like a toy camera, it is one of the most ergonomic and user friendly cameras I have ever used. It puts a modern GoPro to shame. You can even scuba dive with it (after getting the O-rings serviced). \n\nAs someone who enjoys manual metering, I am not afraid of film cameras without batteries and meters. The camera is perfect on land as well as in water. I quite like the heft of it: I think it will be my standard biking and camping camera. I have no worries at all about rolling into a pile of dirt, or falling into water. The 35mm f2.5 lens it came with is also very capable.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/dac661ce52.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" alt=\"A scan of a color photograph of two women looking at San Francisco ferry building as a ferry pulls away from the harbor\" />\n\n*View of San Francisco from the ferry.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/0a51782335.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" alt=\"A scan of a color photograph of a man on a ferry, wearing a yellow jacket looking at Alcatraz in the distance\" />\n\n*A person looking at Alcatraz from the ferry.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/495df449b2.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"406\" alt=\"A scan of a color photograph of a group of people boating near the Bay Bridge\" />\n\n*People on a boat near the Bay Bridge.*\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/41198dd307.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"393\" alt=\"A scan of a color photograph of a ferry causing large waves in the water.

				"title": "Review: How Daido Moriyama Takes Photographs",
				"content_html": "<p>Finished reading: <a href=\"https://micro.blog/books/9781786274243\">Daido Moriyama: How I Take Photographs</a> by Takeshi Nakamoto 📚</p>\n<p>Daido Moriyama is one of the photographers I admire the most. His work (black and white street photography) is an influence on the kind of work I am trying to do in my photography; and his shooting style most resonates with me. He is known to mostly shoot with compact cameras, especially the Ricoh GR series.</p>\n<p>This photography book is unique in that it isn’t just a book of his published photos centered around a theme. Sometimes, I get quite bored of those types of books: Western photographers who go to India, for example, and shoot hundred page photo books that feel vaguely exploitative and white-gazey, are an example of the types of photography I very much dislike.</p>\n<p>Since I know Asia, and Asian cities quite well, I have a finely tuned nose for that sort of thing. I don’t find Asia exotic because, well, I am from there. So I tend to look to the Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi photographers I admire whose body of work situates them within places they work in, where, they have frankly far more interesting things to say. (Dayanita Singh’s photography, for example, does not need to rely on that pop and shock of India’s color or festivals or ‘weirdness’ to make a point: her long term work embedded in local communities tell me so much more about the place than, “India is so strange and exotic!”)</p>\n<p>So it is with Daido Moriyama. There’s no mistaking a Daido Moriyama photograph for someone else’s. No matter where he’s shooting, whether it’s Japan or Argentina. If there is a photographer whose ‘personal vision and style’ I want to learn most, it is his.</p>\n<p>This book is written by his collaborator, a Japanese author and photographer who shadowed Moriyama on several trips, all the while asking: what advice do you have? What are you thinking? What message are you trying to make?</p>\n<p>And all Moriyama says is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just go out and shoot</li>\n<li>Shoot as much as you can (he believes in having quantity as a way to get quality photos)</li>\n<li>He walks up and down a street both ways and he takes about a roll of film per direction</li>\n<li>He thinks there is value in observing the mundane</li>\n<li>Some basic tips, like ‘if you shoot a body of water against the light, the contrast is quite nice especially in black and white’ but he refuses to believe there are any specific tips that are applicable to all</li>\n<li>He cares about doing the work more than talking about the technique or gear</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The book also says that he teaches sometimes, and many of his students are trying to break into fashion or avant garde photography. For those students, he advises that the work is the same as that of someone trying to do photojournalism or documentary photography. Go out and shoot mundane things. Find a building, take a hundred photos of it. Learning to see beauty in the mundane is the most important skill one can develop.</p>\n<p>Each part of the book is based in a certain location. So when he goes to Ginza, for example, there is a photo of the contact sheet that he shot. It was actually nice to see that a master has a ton of duds, too. Not that he ever pretended otherwise: but it was still assuring to know that Daido Moriyama isn’t getting 36 book or exhibition worthy photos out of every roll of 36.</p>\n<p>Lastly, he advises that the most important thing to do when you take a photograph is that you must have a desire to make that photograph. Not necessarily to tell a story or make a point (in fact, he says that arriving somewhere and having a pre-conceived idea of the location or community’s politics or social message is not a good way to take photos, that he prefers to just witness). But that you must feel that you have to take that photo.</p>\n<p>Moriyama also has a lot of things to say about film vs digital. He’s gone digital now, and there’s no going back! Having used both the Ricoh GR film and digital cameras, and also being agnostic to the film vs digital debates (currently, I am shooting more film to learn the darkroom arts specifically, but if I were to go back to working again as a photographer, it would probably make more sense to be digital-first, especially given film costs these days), I think he’s right. The Ricoh GR digital cameras are extremely capable, and they are my favorite film cameras. I do miss the contrasty T-Max grain and quality of his earlier work, but artists are allowed to evolve their vision and tools, and experiment. I appreciate this non-dogmatic quality about Moriyama.</p>\n<p>I would highly recommend this book even if you don’t love this type of street photography. It’s a good way to get an insight into how a great photographer works and thinks, beyond gear talk and such. The world has too much of the latter; but books like these are what I appreciate much, much more.</p>\n",

Sometimes, I get quite bored of those types of books: Western photographers who go to India, for example, and shoot hundred page photo books that feel vaguely exploitative and white-gazey, are an example of the types of photography I very much dislike.\n\nSince I know Asia, and Asian cities quite well, I have a finely tuned nose for that sort of thing. I don’t find Asia exotic because, well, I am from there. So I tend to look to the Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi photographers I admire whose body of work situates them within places they work in, where, they have frankly far more interesting things to say. (Dayanita Singh’s photography, for example, does not need to rely on that pop and shock of India’s color or festivals or ‘weirdness’ to make a point: her long term work embedded in local communities tell me so much more about the place than, “India is so strange and exotic!”)\n\nSo it is with Daido Moriyama. There’s no mistaking a Daido Moriyama photograph for someone else’s. No matter where he’s shooting, whether it’s Japan or Argentina. If there is a photographer whose ‘personal vision and style’ I want to learn most, it is his.\n\nThis book is written by his collaborator, a Japanese author and photographer who shadowed Moriyama on several trips, all the while asking: what advice do you have? What are you thinking? What message are you trying to make?\n\nAnd all Moriyama says is:\n\n- Just go out and shoot\n- Shoot as much as you can (he believes in having quantity as a way to get quality photos)\n- He walks up and down a street both ways and he takes about a roll of film per direction \n- He thinks there is value in observing the mundane\n- Some basic tips, like ‘if you shoot a body of water against the light, the contrast is quite nice especially in black and white’ but he refuses to believe there are any specific tips that are applicable to all\n- He cares about doing the work more than talking about the technique or gear\n\nThe book also says that he teaches sometimes, and many of his students are trying to break into fashion or avant garde photography. For those students, he advises that the work is the same as that of someone trying to do photojournalism or documentary photography. Go out and shoot mundane things. Find a building, take a hundred photos of it. Learning to see beauty in the mundane is the most important skill one can develop.\n\nEach part of the book is based in a certain location. So when he goes to Ginza, for example, there is a photo of the contact sheet that he shot. It was actually nice to see that a master has a ton of duds, too. Not that he ever pretended otherwise: but it was still assuring to know that Daido Moriyama isn’t getting 36 book or exhibition worthy photos out of every roll of 36.\n\nLastly, he advises that the most important thing to do when you take a photograph is that you must have a desire to make that photograph. Not necessarily to tell a story or make a point (in fact, he says that arriving somewhere and having a pre-conceived idea of the location or community’s politics or social message is not a good way to take photos, that he prefers to just witness). But that you must feel that you have to take that photo.\n\nMoriyama also has a lot of things to say about film vs digital. He’s gone digital now, and there’s no going back! Having used both the Ricoh GR film and digital cameras, and also being agnostic to the film vs digital debates (currently, I am shooting more film to learn the darkroom arts specifically, but if I were to go back to working again as a photographer, it would probably make more sense to be digital-first, especially given film costs these days), I think he’s right. The Ricoh GR digital cameras are extremely capable, and they are my favorite film cameras. I do miss the contrasty T-Max grain and quality of his earlier work, but artists are allowed to evolve their vision and tools, and experiment. I appreciate this non-dogmatic quality about Moriyama.\n\nI would highly recommend this book even if you don’t love this type of street photography. It’s a good way to get an insight into how a great photographer works and thinks, beyond gear talk and such. The world has too much of the latter; but books like these are what I appreciate much, much more.\n",

I could get on a $80 flight to India, or take a bus or motorbike to Cambodia, or go meet someone and work with them in Vietnam relatively easily. \r\n\r\n### Singapore, mid early 2000s\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/e275a5ff35.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a person taking a photo in the mirror in an old fashioned changing room\" />\r\n\r\nWhen I was home (I actually had full time college to complete, though it often did not feel like it), I sought out exciting things to do. Growing up, I often heard people say 'Singapore is boring' or 'there's nothing to do here' (even from people who were from there), but I refused to believe that was true.\r\n\r\nI certainly got up to a lot of mischief. Some of it good, some not. In any case, this sort of exploration fueled my curiosity. In this period, I actually wound up writing travel and food guides to Singapore at a variety of places, some online, some in hard copy: which was an exciting way to make money to fund other onward adventures. I also wound up eating at every corner of the country because of that, and I certainly have no complaints.\r\n\r\nMy university wanted me to do an internship at a bank, and I balked. I fought to have this work be recognized as an internship. Eventually, I won. But it was hard fought.\r\n\r\n### Melaka, Malaysia\r\n\r\n*Last year of college*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/e0d2486d7b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" alt=\"a black and white photograph of a person taking a photo of themselves in the mirror in Melaka, Malaysia\" />\r\n\r\nIn my last year of college, I fell in love with a woman who lived 250 miles north of me. We [met sometimes in the middle](https://micro.popagandhi.com/2023/01/29/roadtrips-and-chicken.html). I knew my life was about to change: big time. I guess this photo was a tentative record of that moment. Shortly after, we moved even further away. She moved 8000 kilometres west, and I also moved halfway there. Years later, we would finally live in the same country, the one originally pictured here. We had [such an](https://micro.popagandhi.com/2023/02/14/hari-gawai-some.html) [adventurous life together](https://youtube.com/fortylovetv/videos). I got to see a lot of the world with her, and I got to do many things in this period of my life. We started companies, we made software, we made food, we had a dog. [A dog that's still very much a part of my life today](https://instagram.com/CookieSeniorCav).\r\n\r\n### San Francisco, United States\r\n\r\n*Present day*\r\n\r\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/c82b7f8361.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" alt=\"a color photograph of a queer couple taking a photo in a mirror with a film camera in San Francisco in a gala-like setting with formal attire\" />\r\n\r\nI never thought I would move to America. It wasn't my dream, the way it was for so many people. But life brought us here. Specifically, my marriage brought me here. We needed a place to live that was going to be more... [amenable to our lives](https://popagandhi.com/posts/2021-05-21-schrodingers-lesbian/).\r\n\r\nI think we've built a good life for ourselves. It'll be five years soon. Five years of being married to Sabrena, my wonderful wife, and five years of living here together. I now speak in Fahrenheit, much to her horror. She keeps tabs of all the ways in which I am 'turning American'. \"You speak way too loudly, and just yesterday you scared me when you told me the boiling point of water was 212.\"\r\n\r\nI am sorry.\r\n\r\nWe're part of a community. We go to things. We learn things together. We explore our environment. We fuss over Cookie, our 14 year old dog, and Mila, our 16 year old cat. We trace the ways in which our lives have changed, the ways in which we have, inevitably, become, well, American. It's a bittersweet story.\r\n\r\nBut we are here now. And if you were to tell 20 year old me in the very first photograph that this is going to be my life in the future? I'd be very thankful for the adventures, and be looking forward to this one.\n",

Later, I helped a Thai-Punjabi restauranteur publish a cookbook for their restaurant in Pattaya.\n\nThese were the outtakes from some of these projects.\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/5e8cd90bb7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"A color photograph of some bulbs of garlic\" />\n\n<caption><em>The essential ingredient in many cuisines, garlic.</em></caption>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/b316f41fc9.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"A sepia-toned photo of someone weighing spices with a manual scale\" />\n\n<caption><em>The best part about any cookbook project: going to the market</em></caption>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/0b16b5776f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"A black and white photo of a cast iron cauldron with milk in it, and someone stirring\" />\n\n<caption><em>To make good chai, start with good milk.</em></caption>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/d90b440d7b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"A black and white photo of someone pouring milk from Indian-style steel cups\" />\n\n<caption><em>I love those steel cups.</em></caption>\n\n<img src=\"uploads/2023/78655e8c90.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"A color photograph of 9 spices arranged in a grid\" />\n\n<caption><em>Spices are the variety of life.</em></caption>\n",
