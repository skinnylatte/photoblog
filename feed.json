The metal stuff sticking out of the kitchen window is a laundry pole holder. We put our clothes on bamboo sticks, then stick the stick into the laundry pole holder, and air dry clothes that way. The traditional way. Nicer than a dryer.*\n\nMy apartment overlooked a bad mall. But it was where I went to spend all my money at the arcade (Time Crisis 2, I still resent you); meet dates, grab food, shop for groceries. It was *my* bad mall. I don't think I will miss it. But it will be weird to not longer have it in my life.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8917/2023/7b390abed5.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"a color photograph of a view of a Singapore mall next to a canal and tall buildings around it\" />\n\n*Farewell, West Coast Plaza.*\n\nI am frequently traipsing around in the green bits of Singapore. There's quite a lot of it, actually. Many of the 'wilder' bits I used to walk around in for fun, now have names and signs and sometimes, buildings. Like the [Green Corridor](https://www.havehalalwilltravel.com/green-corridor-rail-singapore). I *liked* the tropical forest. I even lived in one for a while.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8917/2023/1e52d9bca3.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"399\" alt=\"a color photograph of some green trees and blue skies in Singapore\" />\n\n*Some trees near Queensway. View from the road. I lived in an old house deep inside, which could be accessed via a shortcut through this bit of green. They're building on it now.*\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/8917/2023/e502906ed7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"a color photograph of a queer couple in wedding clothes walking along a bridge that is in a forest in Singapore\" />\n\n*I like the trees so much, I even had my wedding photos taken there. These were the former railway tracks to Malaysia.*\n\nIn the end, I'm just but a small cog in the wheel that is Singapore, that keeps turning. My memories and my life there fade every year. It's the same, but different (for me). When we took that photo in our wedding whites at the train tracks in Bukit Timah, we were about to move to the United States. I guess intellectually I knew what was going to happen. But emotionally? I was never ready. Maybe I still am not.\n\n*All photos taken on Ricoh GR III*\n",

Walking away from Chinatown and into the Financial District, when I see signs for 'French Laundry', I'm also reminded of how, not too long ago, that was [thinly veiled code for 'no Asians'](https://ask.metafilter.com/211295/Why-are-French-laundry-and-Chinese-laundry-things), but now it's just one of the most famous restaurants in the world. California is weird like that. Everyone tells you you are welcome, until you're not, but until then you're free to build your community, until you're not. For what it's worth, it's now home. \n",

Certainly, there are some well known bakeries in the city known for their sourdough, but that&rsquo;s not a style or type of bread I enjoy at all.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s for everyone, but I like Chinese and Japanese bakeries. I like soft, pillowy breads that straddle the line between savory and sweet. I like hot dogs in my buns. I like ham in my bread. I like scallions in them, too. Barbecue pork. Eggs. All of it. My palate leans heavily on the savory side of things, and I also prefer my breads that way. Salty. Savory. I opine on that, and more, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&amp;t=4s\">in this video</a>.</p>\n<p>As part of my increasing frustration at the perennial sour-ness of bread in the city I now live in, I seek out Chinese bakeries. Here are a few of my favorites.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/hgwP4Wq3j8Tn6CNy7\">Mee Mee bakery</a> in Chinatown (pictured), is known for its &lsquo;cow ear cookies&rsquo; or &lsquo;pig ear cookies&rsquo;, a savory spiral biscuit that&rsquo;s really more salty than sweet. I love that shit.</p>\n<p>I also like <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/6edZvEUcsJAS4pkC8\">Yummy Bakery</a> for Hong Kong style &lsquo;paper cup cakes&rsquo;, which are fluffier and softer than American cupcakes; almost like a souffle, but like paper. If that makes sense. Also try their egg white tarts and wife cakes.</p>\n<p>In the Outer Mission, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/k9DJMAcMoYmUKi4Q6\">Princess Bakery</a> is an old school favorite. Try the coconut buns and the hot dog scallion buns. In the same neighborhood, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/yQcFvBsLDoPpL1YZ8\">Hong Kong Bakery</a> is a classic. Don&rsquo;t sleep on the Excelsior: I think it has the highest density of my favorite Chinese food in the city, more than Chinatown and more than the Sunset or Richmond.</p>\n<p>Lastly, <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/fSQsaUxc8FqUQvTJ6\">Pineapple King Bakery</a>, like I <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&amp;t=4s\">recommend in the YouTube show</a>. Try literally anything there, and definitely don&rsquo;t skip the milk tea. I wish there were more Japanese bakeries in the city, but there are not. I&rsquo;m glad people enjoy the sourdough of San Francisco, but I&rsquo;m overjoyed that I have these alternatives here. I&rsquo;m trying to take the perspective of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay to not like things&rdquo;, but it is so goddamn hard when it&rsquo;s so hard to find good bread in this city that isn&rsquo;t surprisingly sour. (Recently, I bought a bag of bagels, and it was made of sourdough. Without warning. Sour simply isn&rsquo;t a flavor I enjoy: <a href=\"https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/109832248412123015\">I also feel that way about American hot sauce</a>.)</p>\n",

I opine on that, and more, [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&t=4s).\n\nAs part of my increasing frustration at the perennial sour-ness of bread in the city I now live in, I seek out Chinese bakeries. Here are a few of my favorites.\n\n[Mee Mee bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/hgwP4Wq3j8Tn6CNy7) in Chinatown (pictured), is known for its 'cow ear cookies' or 'pig ear cookies', a savory spiral biscuit that's really more salty than sweet. I love that shit.\n\nI also like [Yummy Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/6edZvEUcsJAS4pkC8) for Hong Kong style 'paper cup cakes', which are fluffier and softer than American cupcakes; almost like a souffle, but like paper. If that makes sense. Also try their egg white tarts and wife cakes.\n\nIn the Outer Mission, [Princess Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/k9DJMAcMoYmUKi4Q6) is an old school favorite. Try the coconut buns and the hot dog scallion buns. In the same neighborhood, [Hong Kong Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/yQcFvBsLDoPpL1YZ8) is a classic. Don't sleep on the Excelsior: I think it has the highest density of my favorite Chinese food in the city, more than Chinatown and more than the Sunset or Richmond.\n\nLastly, [Pineapple King Bakery](https://goo.gl/maps/fSQsaUxc8FqUQvTJ6), like I [recommend in the YouTube show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7BRqpyroBQ&t=4s). Try literally anything there, and definitely don't skip the milk tea. I wish there were more Japanese bakeries in the city, but there are not. I'm glad people enjoy the sourdough of San Francisco, but I'm overjoyed that I have these alternatives here. I'm trying to take the perspective of \"it's okay to not like things\", but it is so goddamn hard when it's so hard to find good bread in this city that isn't surprisingly sour. (Recently, I bought a bag of bagels, and it was made of sourdough. Without warning. Sour simply isn't a flavor I enjoy: [I also feel that way about American hot sauce](https://hachyderm.io/@skinnylatte/109832248412123015).)\n",

I love everything about it.\n\nFrom the moment I was given a disposable film camera as a child, to collecting old cameras and taking them on my travels, I love the whole process of waiting to see what photos I come back with.\n\nLike so many others, I have been mostly digital for a while. That's fine. I don't much care for the film vs digital debate; but I _love_ film cameras, the older the better.\n\nAt the end of 2022, I decided to jump back into film again. I now live somewhere else (San Francisco), have more time and ability to indulge this admittedly expensive and indulgent hobby, and also generally feel like I have more stories I'd like to share.\n\nBefore I do that, I'd like to start at the beginning.\n\n17 years ago: this was me in a different place and time. With the same old hobby.
